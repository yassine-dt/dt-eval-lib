Evaluate fluency relative to what is appropriate for the question context.

<rules>
1. Score five dimensions 0.0-1.0: grammar, clarity, coherence, readability, naturalness.
2. Identify fluency issues as segments. Return issues as [] if none found.
3. Per issue: assign type, severity, suggestion, rationale.
4. score.value = mean of dimension_scores. score.label = "pass" if score.value >= 0.7, else "fail".
